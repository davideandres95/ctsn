# Coding Theory for Storage and Networks
This repository includes lab exercises from the lecture 'Coding Theory for Storage and Networks' from the LNT, TUM.
Most of the exercises are coded using Sage inside of Jupyter notebooks.

Topics cover:
- Coding for efficient data recovery in distributed data storage: locally repairable codes and regenerating codes.
- Decoding of Reed-Solomon codes beyond half the minimum distance: list decoding, power decoding.
- Interleaved Reed-Solomon codes and algorithms to correct burst errors.
- Streaming codes for decoding with minimum delays.
- Coding for correcting insertions and deletions.
- Network coding: Rank-metric codes, subspace codes, application to error-correction in networks.

Additionaly there is report explaining two of the labs at: ./Lab_Report/Lab_Report.pdf. Check it out if your are interested in knowing more
